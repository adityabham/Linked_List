Templated doubly linked list 
Tester(counts.cpp): takes two command line arguments (both of which name files), 
reads in those files--splitting them into "words", 
counts how many occurences of each word there are in the first file, 
removes all the words that appear in the second file,
sorts the remaining list, and prints the results.
